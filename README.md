# Polynomial indicator of flat bands

The above python file implements a method that symbolically computes the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix. Greatest common divisor of these coefficients then serves to indicate the existence of flat bands in the associated crystal lattice. The files also contains several illustrations of the use of this method.
